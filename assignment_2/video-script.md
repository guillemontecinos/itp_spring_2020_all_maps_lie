* *Showing zoom out*: According to the 2017 census, about 12% of the chilean population live in rural areas, a considerable population that is usually postponed by the public services and development. Many of these hamlets correspond to peasant and indigenous communities that have lived for years in the same land.

* *Showing screenshots collected*: As an attempt to address and reveal this reality, the project aims be an atlas of forgotten small communities settled on isolated areas of the chilean countryside. The goal of this is to reveal a hidden imagery of Chile, that of the forgotten people that live in the most amazing landscapes but lack of basic services as electricity, drinking water or sewage.

* *Showing mockup*: The atlas will be displayed as a website where aerial imagery of isolated settlements scraped from Google Maps are presented.

* *Showing the dataset*: The atlas will be based on the Chilean Settlements dataset, a database that contains more than 15,000 georeferenced Chilean settlements, many of which are incorrectly mapped and point uninhabited areas. This information will be used to scrape images from Google Maps for each of the points, at a height of 1,000 m. Later, the dataset will be reviewed and all unihabited points will be cleaned. This resulting dataset will be used to build the atlas.

A second stage of this project is to create an open platform where people can map unmapped settlements, adding information about them.
